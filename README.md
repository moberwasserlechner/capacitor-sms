Plugin for sending short messages using the device's SMS app.

## Installation

`npm i @byteowls/capacitor-sms`

Minimum Capacitor version is **2.0.0**

## Configuration

This example shows the common process of configuring this plugin.

Although it was taken from a Angular 6 application, it should work in other frameworks as well.

### Register plugin

Find the init component of your app, which is in Angular `app.component.ts` and register this plugin by

```
import {registerWebPlugin} from "@capacitor/core";
import {SmsManager} from '@byteowls/capacitor-sms';

@Component()
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {

    ngOnInit() {
        console.log("Register custom capacitor plugins");
        registerWebPlugin(SmsManager);
        // other stuff
    }
}
```

### Use it

This plugin always uses the default sms app.

Google prevented me from using SMS_SEND permission so I dropped the support
here because the plugin is much easier to maintain if only one feature is supported.

```typescript
      for (const m of messages) {
        const numbers: string[] = [];
        for (const r of m.recipients) {
          numbers.push(r.mobile);
        }
        Plugins.SmsManager.send({
          numbers: numbers,
          text: m.content,
        }).then(() => {
          // SMS app was opened
        }).catch(error => {
            // see error codes below
            if (error.message !== "SEND_CANCELLED") {
                // show toast with error message
                console.log(error.message);
            }
        });
      }
```

### Error Codes

* SEND_CANCELLED ... User cancelled or closed the SMS app. (ios only)
* ERR_SEND_FAILED ... The SMS app returned that sending the message to the recipients failed. (ios only)
* ERR_SEND_UNKNOWN_STATE ... The SMS app returned a unknown state. There is nothing I can do to clarify the error. (ios only)
* ERR_PLATFORM_NOT_SUPPORTED ... Sending SMS on the web is not supported.
* ERR_NO_NUMBERS ... No recipient numbers were retrieved from options. Make sure to deliver only valid numbers, because the whole sending will fail.
* ERR_NO_TEXT ... No message text was retrieved from options.
* ERR_SERVICE_NOTFOUND ... The used device can not send SMS.

## Platform: Android

**Register the plugin** in `com.companyname.appname.MainActivity#onCreate`

```
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        List<Class<? extends Plugin>> additionalPlugins = new ArrayList<>();
        // Additional plugins you've installed go here
        // Ex: additionalPlugins.add(TotallyAwesomePlugin.class);
        additionalPlugins.add(SmsManagerPlugin.class);

        // Initializes the Bridge
        this.init(savedInstanceState, additionalPlugins);
    }
```
