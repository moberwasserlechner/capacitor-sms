Plugin for sending short messages using the device's SMS app.

## Installation

`npm i @byteowls/capacitor-sms`

Minimum Capacitor version is **3.0.0**

### Capacitor 2.x
`npm i @byteowls/capacitor-sms@2`

## Configuration

This example shows the common process of configuring this plugin.

Although it was taken from a Angular 6 application, it should work in other frameworks as well.

### Use it

This plugin always uses the default sms app.

Google prevented me from using SMS_SEND permission so I dropped the support
here because the plugin is much easier to maintain if only one feature is supported.

```typescript
      for (const m of messages) {
        const numbers: string[] = [];
        for (const r of m.recipients) {
          numbers.push(r.mobile);
        }
        Plugins.SmsManager.send({
          numbers: numbers,
          text: m.content,
        }).then(() => {
          // SMS app was opened
        }).catch(error => {
            // see error codes below
            if (error.message !== "SEND_CANCELLED") {
                // show toast with error message
                console.log(error.message);
            }
        });
      }
```

### Error Codes

* SEND_CANCELLED ... User cancelled or closed the SMS app. (ios only)
* ERR_SEND_FAILED ... The SMS app returned that sending the message to the recipients failed. (ios only)
* ERR_SEND_UNKNOWN_STATE ... The SMS app returned a unknown state. There is nothing I can do to clarify the error. (ios only)
* ERR_PLATFORM_NOT_SUPPORTED ... Sending SMS on the web is not supported.
* ERR_NO_NUMBERS ... No recipient numbers were retrieved from options. Make sure to deliver only valid numbers, because the whole sending will fail.
* ERR_NO_TEXT ... No message text was retrieved from options.
* ERR_SERVICE_NOTFOUND ... The used device can not send SMS.

            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
            ...
